I\'m Debarshi Pathak (alias <highlightttw link="https://twitter.com/DebAxom" n-scope="DQDyVykorKnN5">DebAxom</highlightttw>), the creator of Nijor. <br n-scope="DQDyVykorKnN5">\n        I am the Assamese teenager who created Nijor in 2020 at the age of 14 (was about to turn 15). <br n-scope="DQDyVykorKnN5"><br n-scope="DQDyVykorKnN5">\n\n        I created Nijor because I didn\'t want to learn React or Angular as I felt that learning those frameworks is like kinda learning a new language completely. So I decided to create my own framework, Nijor. <br n-scope="DQDyVykorKnN5">\n        The word <highlightttw n-scope="DQDyVykorKnN5">Nijor (‡¶®‡¶ø‡¶ú‡ß∞)</highlightttw> means "My" or "Mine" in the Assamese language. I chose the word "Nijor" for my framework because I could create "my own" custom HTML tags with attributes. I\'ve been using NijorJS since 2020 and I decided to write the <highlightttw link="/docs" n-scope="DQDyVykorKnN5">docs</highlightttw> in 2023. <br n-scope="DQDyVykorKnN5"><br n-scope="DQDyVykorKnN5">\n        \n        Nijor has been inspired by Vue and Svelte and it\'s influence can be felt. The idea of <highlightttw n-scope="DQDyVykorKnN5">*.nijor</highlightttw> files came from <highlightttw n-scope="DQDyVykorKnN5">*.vue</highlightttw> files and the idea of a compiler came from Svelte. I even tried to take some inspiration from their source code, but I couldn\'t understand their code. So, I had to implement all the features of this framework from scratch (I did steal some code from StalkOverflow though üòÅ). <br n-scope="DQDyVykorKnN5"><br n-scope="DQDyVykorKnN5">\n\n        My core philosophy behind Nijor is simplicity : The framework should have a very flat learning curve. Due to this philosophy, <highlightttw n-scope="DQDyVykorKnN5">*.nijor</highlightttw> files are more closely related to <highlightttw n-scope="DQDyVykorKnN5">*.html</highlightttw> files than <highlightttw n-scope="DQDyVykorKnN5">*.js</highlightttw> files as it\'s easier to write JS inside HTML rather than the other way round. <br n-scope="DQDyVykorKnN5"><br n-scope="DQDyVykorKnN5">\n        \n        Nijor is not a perfect framework ; just like everything in this world, Nijor too has it\'s flaws and it might be confusing at times. <br n-scope="DQDyVykorKnN5"><br n-scope="DQDyVykorKnN5">\n        \n        At last, I\'d like to thank the Svelte creator Rich-Harris for creating Rollup JS as without Rollup it\'d have been impossible for me to create the Nijor compiler.\n        </sectionttw>\n    </div>\n'}),(async function(){e.init("sectionttw"),await e.run(),t.init("highlightttw"),await t.run()}));export{o as default};
