All the pages in your app are lazy-loaded and there\'s no way to change it !\n    </sectiony5>\n    <sectiony5 title="Lazy-loading a component" n-scope="FI641W40y5SE">\n        To lazy-load a component, just add the <highlighty5 n-scope="FI641W40y5SE">lazy</highlighty5> attribute after it.\n        <codey5 n-scope="FI641W40y5SE">\n            &lt;card1 n:imported="components/card.nijor"/&gt; &lt;!--Without Lazy Loading--&gt;\n            &lt;card2 n:imported="components/card.nijor" lazy/&gt; &lt;!--With Lazy Loading--&gt;\n        </codey5>\n    </sectiony5>\n'}),(async function(){e.init("sectiony5"),await e.run(),n.init("highlighty5"),await n.run(),t.init("codey5"),await t.run()}));export{o as default};
