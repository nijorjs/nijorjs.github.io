Unlike traditional approaches, Nijor\'s routing mechanism renders routes within the same page, eliminating the need for page refreshes and delivering a seamless user experience. </section_hfpwti><section_hfpwti title="File-Based Routing"> Nijor simplifies the process of rendering pages for different routes by utilizing file-based routing. This means that developers are relieved from the responsibility of manually coding the rendering logic for each route. Instead, Nijor\'s compiler automatically handles this based on the organization of files in the <highlight_hfpwti>src/pages</highlight_hfpwti> directory of your Nijor project. <br n-scope="hfpwti"><br n-scope="hfpwti"> To illustrate this behavior, let\'s consider an example. When a user visits the \'/\' route of our website, the page rendered will be src/pages/index.nijor. Similarly, accessing the \'/about\' route will trigger the rendering of src/pages/about.nijor. In the event that a route doesn\'t exist, Nijor will render src/pages/404.nijor. This convenient approach streamlines the development process and improves overall efficiency. </section_hfpwti><section_hfpwti title="Understanding the App.nijor file"> The <highlight_hfpwti>App.nijor</highlight_hfpwti> is the root component that gets rendered before anything else ; all the other components and pages get rendered inside it. Without this page, the Nijor router simply won\'t work. You can render those components in this page which remain same in all the pages, thus preventing the need for rerendering the common components during navigation through different routes. <br n-scope="hfpwti"> The App.nijor file must have the <highlight_hfpwti>&lt;div n:slot&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</highlight_hfpwti> in the <highlight_hfpwti>App.nijor</highlight_hfpwti> file. The content from the routes (pages from the src/page/ dir) will be rendered inside this special tag. <pre n-scope="hfpwti"><code lang="html" n-scope="hfpwti">\n        &lt;body&gt;\n            &lt;div n:slot&gt;\n                &lt;!--All the pages from the src/pages directory are rendered inside this div (marked with the n:slot attribute). \n                    Anything outside this div is always rendered irrespective of route.\n                    You can write code for common header or footer outside this div so that it renders in every page, #Reasuablity\n                --&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n\n            &lt;!-- Note : Do not add an \'id\' attribute to the div with the n:slot attribute.
