I\'m Debarshi Pathak (alias <highlight_innw link="https://twitter.com/DebAxom" n-scope="innw">DebAxom</highlight_innw>), the creator of Nijor. <br n-scope="innw"> I am the Assamese teenager who created Nijor in 2020 at the age of 14 (was about to turn 15). <br n-scope="innw"><br n-scope="innw"> I created Nijor because I didn\'t want to learn React or Angular as I felt that learning those frameworks is like kinda learning a new language completely. So I decided to create my own framework, Nijor. <br n-scope="innw"> The word <highlight_innw n-scope="innw">Nijor (‡¶®‡¶ø‡¶ú‡ß∞)</highlight_innw> means "My" or "Mine" in the Assamese language. I chose the word "Nijor" for my framework because I could create "my own" custom HTML tags with attributes. I\'ve been using NijorJS since 2020 and I decided to write the <highlight_innw link="/docs" n-scope="innw">docs</highlight_innw> in 2023. <br n-scope="innw"><br n-scope="innw"> Nijor has been inspired by Vue and Svelte and it\'s influence can be felt. The idea of <highlight_innw n-scope="innw">*.nijor</highlight_innw> files came from <highlight_innw n-scope="innw">*.vue</highlight_innw> files and the idea of a compiler came from Svelte. I even tried to take some inspiration from their source code, but I couldn\'t understand their code. So, I had to implement all the features of this framework from scratch (I did steal some code from StalkOverflow though üòÅ). <br n-scope="innw"><br n-scope="innw"> My core philosophy behind Nijor is simplicity : The framework should have a very flat learning curve. Due to this philosophy, <highlight_innw n-scope="innw">*.nijor</highlight_innw> files are more closely related to <highlight_innw n-scope="innw">*.html</highlight_innw> files than <highlight_innw n-scope="innw">*.js</highlight_innw> files as it\'s easier to write JS inside HTML rather than the other way round. <br n-scope="innw"><br n-scope="innw"> Nijor is not a perfect framework ; just like everything in this world, Nijor too has it\'s flaws and it might be confusing at times. <br n-scope="innw"><br n-scope="innw"> At last, I\'d like to thank the Svelte creator Rich-Harris for creating Rollup JS as without Rollup it\'d have been impossible for me to create the Nijor compiler. </section_innw></div>'}),(async function(){i.init("highlight_innw"),await i.run(),i.init("highlight_innw"),await i.run(),i.init("highlight_innw"),await i.run(),i.init("highlight_innw"),await i.run(),i.init("highlight_innw"),await i.run(),i.init("highlight_innw"),await i.run(),i.init("highlight_innw"),await i.run(),i.init("highlight_innw"),await i.run(),n.init("section_innw"),await n.run()}));export{e as default};
