I\'m Debarshi Pathak (alias <highlightjafo link="https://twitter.com/DebAxom" n-scope="AT6cJpwQvtBQS">DebAxom</highlightjafo>), the creator of Nijor. <br n-scope="AT6cJpwQvtBQS">\n        I am the Assamese teenager who created Nijor in 2020 at the age of 14 (was about to turn 15). <br n-scope="AT6cJpwQvtBQS"><br n-scope="AT6cJpwQvtBQS">\n\n        I created Nijor because I didn\'t want to learn React or Angular as I felt that learning those frameworks is like kinda learning a new language completely. So I decided to create my own framework, Nijor. <br n-scope="AT6cJpwQvtBQS">\n        The word <highlightjafo n-scope="AT6cJpwQvtBQS">Nijor (‡¶®‡¶ø‡¶ú‡ß∞)</highlightjafo> means "My" or "Mine" in the Assamese language. I chose the word "Nijor" for my framework because I could create "my own" custom HTML tags with attributes. I\'ve been using NijorJS since 2020 and I decided to write the <highlightjafo link="/docs" n-scope="AT6cJpwQvtBQS">docs</highlightjafo> in 2023. <br n-scope="AT6cJpwQvtBQS"><br n-scope="AT6cJpwQvtBQS">\n        \n        Nijor has been inspired by Vue and Svelte and it\'s influence can be felt. The idea of <highlightjafo n-scope="AT6cJpwQvtBQS">*.nijor</highlightjafo> files came from <highlightjafo n-scope="AT6cJpwQvtBQS">*.vue</highlightjafo> files and the idea of a compiler came from Svelte. I even tried to take some inspiration from their source code, but I couldn\'t understand their code. So, I had to implement all the features of this framework from scratch (I did steal some code from StalkOverflow though üòÅ). <br n-scope="AT6cJpwQvtBQS"><br n-scope="AT6cJpwQvtBQS">\n\n        My core philosophy behind Nijor is simplicity : The framework should have a very flat learning curve. Due to this philosophy, <highlightjafo n-scope="AT6cJpwQvtBQS">*.nijor</highlightjafo> files are more closely related to <highlightjafo n-scope="AT6cJpwQvtBQS">*.html</highlightjafo> files than <highlightjafo n-scope="AT6cJpwQvtBQS">*.js</highlightjafo> files as it\'s easier to write JS inside HTML rather than the other way round. <br n-scope="AT6cJpwQvtBQS"><br n-scope="AT6cJpwQvtBQS">\n        \n        Nijor is not a perfect framework ; just like everything in this world, Nijor too has it\'s flaws and it might be confusing at times. <br n-scope="AT6cJpwQvtBQS"><br n-scope="AT6cJpwQvtBQS">\n        \n        At last, I\'d like to thank the Svelte creator Rich-Harris for creating Rollup JS as without Rollup it\'d have been impossible for me to create the Nijor compiler.\n        </sectionjafo>\n    </div>\n'}),(async function(){e.init("sectionjafo"),await e.run(),t.init("highlightjafo"),await t.run()}));export{o as default};
