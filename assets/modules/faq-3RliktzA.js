I\'m Debarshi Pathak (alias <highlight_faju7 link="https://twitter.com/DebAxom" n-scope="faju7">DebAxom</highlight_faju7>), the creator of Nijor. <br n-scope="faju7"> I am the Assamese teenager who created Nijor in 2020 at the age of 14 (was about to turn 15). <br n-scope="faju7"><br n-scope="faju7"> I created Nijor because I didn\'t want to learn React or Angular as I felt that learning those frameworks is like kinda learning a new language completely. So I decided to create my own framework, Nijor. <br n-scope="faju7"> The word <highlight_faju7 n-scope="faju7">Nijor (‡¶®‡¶ø‡¶ú‡ß∞)</highlight_faju7> means "My" or "Mine" in the Assamese language. I chose the word "Nijor" for my framework because I could create "my own" custom HTML tags with attributes. I\'ve been using NijorJS since 2020 and I decided to write the <highlight_faju7 link="/docs" n-scope="faju7">docs</highlight_faju7> in 2023. <br n-scope="faju7"><br n-scope="faju7"> Nijor has been inspired by Vue and Svelte and it\'s influence can be felt. The idea of <highlight_faju7 n-scope="faju7">*.nijor</highlight_faju7> files came from <highlight_faju7 n-scope="faju7">*.vue</highlight_faju7> files and the idea of a compiler came from Svelte. I even tried to take some inspiration from their source code, but I couldn\'t understand their code. So, I had to implement all the features of this framework from scratch (I did steal some code from StalkOverflow though üòÅ). <br n-scope="faju7"><br n-scope="faju7"> My core philosophy behind Nijor is simplicity : The framework should have a very flat learning curve. Due to this philosophy, <highlight_faju7 n-scope="faju7">*.nijor</highlight_faju7> files are more closely related to <highlight_faju7 n-scope="faju7">*.html</highlight_faju7> files than <highlight_faju7 n-scope="faju7">*.js</highlight_faju7> files as it\'s easier to write JS inside HTML rather than the other way round. <br n-scope="faju7"><br n-scope="faju7"> Nijor is not a perfect framework ; just like everything in this world, Nijor too has it\'s flaws and it might be confusing at times. <br n-scope="faju7"><br n-scope="faju7"> At last, I\'d like to thank the Svelte creator Rich-Harris for creating Rollup JS as without Rollup it\'d have been impossible for me to create the Nijor compiler. And I\'d also thank Evan You for creating Rolldown JS and as Nijor has moved to Rolldown since June 2025 for faster performance. </section_faju7></div>'}),(async function(){e.init("highlight_faju7"),await e.run(),e.init("highlight_faju7"),await e.run(),e.init("highlight_faju7"),await e.run(),e.init("highlight_faju7"),await e.run(),e.init("highlight_faju7"),await e.run(),e.init("highlight_faju7"),await e.run(),e.init("highlight_faju7"),await e.run(),e.init("highlight_faju7"),await e.run(),i.init("section_faju7"),await i.run()}));export{a as default};
