All the pages in your app are lazy-loaded and there\'s no way to change it !\n    </sectionswz>\n    <sectionswz title="Lazy-loading a component" n-scope="7SbCcNngy7ZCR8">\n        To lazy-load a component, just add the <highlightswz n-scope="7SbCcNngy7ZCR8">lazy</highlightswz> attribute after it.\n        <codeswz n-scope="7SbCcNngy7ZCR8">\n            &lt;card1 n:imported="components/card.nijor"/&gt; &lt;!--Without Lazy Loading--&gt;\n            &lt;card2 n:imported="components/card.nijor" lazy/&gt; &lt;!--With Lazy Loading--&gt;\n        </codeswz>\n    </sectionswz>\n'}),(async function(){n.init("sectionswz"),await n.run(),e.init("highlightswz"),await e.run(),i.init("codeswz"),await i.run()}));export{t as default};
