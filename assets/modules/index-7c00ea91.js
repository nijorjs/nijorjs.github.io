I\'m Debarshi Pathak (alias <highlightajxo link="https://twitter.com/DebAxom" n-scope="wBM2pCD">DebAxom</highlightajxo>), the creator of Nijor. <br n-scope="wBM2pCD">\n        I am the Assamese teenager who created Nijor in 2020 at the age of 14 (was about to turn 15). <br n-scope="wBM2pCD"><br n-scope="wBM2pCD">\n\n        I created Nijor because I didn\'t want to learn React or Angular as I felt that learning those frameworks is like kinda learning a new language completely. So I decided to create my own framework, Nijor. <br n-scope="wBM2pCD">\n        The word <highlightajxo n-scope="wBM2pCD">Nijor (‡¶®‡¶ø‡¶ú‡ß∞)</highlightajxo> means "My" or "Mine" in the Assamese language. I chose the word "Nijor" for my framework because I could create "my own" custom HTML tags with attributes. I\'ve been using NijorJS since 2020 and I decided to write the <highlightajxo link="/docs" n-scope="wBM2pCD">docs</highlightajxo> in 2023. <br n-scope="wBM2pCD"><br n-scope="wBM2pCD">\n        \n        Nijor has been inspired by Vue and Svelte and it\'s influence can be felt. The idea of <highlightajxo n-scope="wBM2pCD">*.nijor</highlightajxo> files came from <highlightajxo n-scope="wBM2pCD">*.vue</highlightajxo> files and the idea of a compiler came from Svelte. I even tried to take some inspiration from their source code, but I couldn\'t understand their code. So, I had to implement all the features of this framework from scratch (I did steal some code from StalkOverflow though üòÅ). <br n-scope="wBM2pCD"><br n-scope="wBM2pCD">\n\n        My core philosophy behind Nijor is simplicity : The framework should have a very flat learning curve. Due to this philosophy, <highlightajxo n-scope="wBM2pCD">*.nijor</highlightajxo> files are more closely related to <highlightajxo n-scope="wBM2pCD">*.html</highlightajxo> files than <highlightajxo n-scope="wBM2pCD">*.js</highlightajxo> files as it\'s easier to write JS inside HTML rather than the other way round. <br n-scope="wBM2pCD"><br n-scope="wBM2pCD">\n        \n        Nijor is not a perfect framework ; just like everything in this world, Nijor too has it\'s flaws and it might be confusing at times. <br n-scope="wBM2pCD"><br n-scope="wBM2pCD">\n        \n        At last, I\'d like to thank the Svelte creator Rich-Harris for creating Rollup JS as without Rollup it\'d have been impossible for me to create the Nijor compiler.\n        </sectionajxo>\n    </div>\n'}),(async function(){e.init("sectionajxo"),await e.run(),o.init("highlightajxo"),await o.run()}));export{i as default};
